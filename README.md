# Soundwave
Implementation of Soundwave [1] on IOS devices.

Soundwave sends a high frequency signal (18 Khz, usually inaudible) through speaker and receives reflections of the signal through micorphone. Then it uses doppler effect generated by moving hand (when positioned near the speaker and microphone) to estimate whether the user gesture is "push" or "pull". 

## Run
Simply compile and run in xcode!

## Requirement
This code uses SwiftUI, so it requires target devices to be at IOS 13 or later.

## Limitations
This code has been tested thoroughly on iPad 6th generation. Note that the code requires sample rate of input and output to be at 44.1 Khz. Since some Apple devices may have a different sample rate, e.g. 48 Khz, rurnning the program at those frequency may generate errors. This is because the signal generator of the code may generate a different frequency, biasing the results in the classifier.
